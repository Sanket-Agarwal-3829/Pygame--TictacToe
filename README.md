Tic-Tac-Toe
A basic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Pygame. This project was part of my early Python learning journey, focusing on understanding game loops, user input handling, and basic GUI development using the Pygame library.

Features
Two-player mode: Players take turns marking the grid with "X" and "O".
Win Detection: The game detects when a player has won by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
Draw Detection: If the grid is full with no winner, the game announces a draw.
Simple User Interface: A minimalistic grid-based UI where players can click to place their mark.
